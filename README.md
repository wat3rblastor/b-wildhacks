# GoodNeighbor

GoodNeighbor is a platform designed to connect urban residents and property owners with skilled contractors and service providers for small-scale urban development tasks. Whether it's fixing a pothole, painting a pedestrian crosswalk, installing bike racks, or beautifying a neighborhood park, GoodNeighbor facilitates quick and efficient transactions between those in need of services and those able to provide them.

## Key Features

### Task Posting
Users can post small urban development tasks they need assistance with, providing details such as location, task description, and budget.

### Contractor Matching
Contractors and service providers can browse available tasks in their area and apply for those that match their skills and availability.

### Bidding System
Contractors can submit bids for tasks, allowing users to choose the most suitable contractor based on factors like price, reviews, and completion time.

### Community Engagement
GoodNeighbor fosters community engagement by allowing users to collaborate on neighborhood improvement projects, share ideas, and track the progress of ongoing initiatives.

### Feedback and Reviews
Both users and contractors can leave feedback and reviews after completing a task, helping to maintain quality standards and build trust within the GoodNeighbor community.

## About

With GoodNeighbor, residents and property owners can easily address small-scale urban development needs, contributing to the enhancement and beautification of their communities while providing opportunities for contractors to earn income through microtransactions.

## Project Architecture
The GoodNeighbor platform was built using a modern architecture that leverages Next.js for both the frontend and backend components. This choice was made to streamline development, improve performance, and ensure a seamless user experience across the entire application.

### Frontend
The frontend of the GoodNeighbor platform is built using Next.js, a popular React framework known for its simplicity, performance, and excellent developer experience. Next.js allows us to create dynamic, server-rendered React applications with ease, making it ideal for building robust web applications like GoodNeighbor.

With Next.js, we were able to implement features such as:

Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js provides built-in support for SSR, allowing us to generate HTML on the server and deliver fully rendered pages to the client, resulting in faster load times and improved SEO.

Static site generation (SSG): Next.js also supports SSG, enabling us to pre-render static pages at build time, further enhancing performance and reducing server load.

API routes: Next.js allows us to create API routes directly within our application, making it easy to build backend functionality alongside our frontend codebase. These API routes handle tasks such as user authentication, task posting, bidding, and more.

### Backend
While Next.js primarily serves as our frontend framework, it also plays a crucial role in handling backend functionality through its API routes. These routes serve as endpoints for client-server communication, enabling seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components of our application.

Using Next.js for both frontend and backend offers several advantages, including:

Simplified development: By using a single framework for both frontend and backend development, we can maintain a unified codebase, reducing complexity and improving code maintainability.

Improved performance: Next.js's SSR and SSG capabilities contribute to improved performance, ensuring fast page loads and responsive user interfaces.

Overall, leveraging Next.js for frontend and backend development has allowed us to create a powerful, feature-rich platform like GoodNeighbor while benefiting from the simplicity and performance of a unified framework.
